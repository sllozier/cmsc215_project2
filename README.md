# Academic Honor Society Evaluator


## Description

This Java program is designed to assess and manage student academic records for honor society eligibility. It reads student data (including name, credit hours, quality points, and year or degree) from a generated students.txt file, then creates appropriate Student, Undergraduate, or Graduate objects. The program calculates the average GPA, sets a dynamic threshold for honor society eligibility, and displays a report listing eligible students. It's structured as a Maven project with separate modules for data generation and core functionality, and includes a suite of JUnit tests for validation.
